### HelmetVision Dataset Summary

The **HelmetVision Dataset** is a comprehensive image dataset designed for binary classification tasks, specifically focused on detecting whether a rider is wearing a helmet or not. This dataset is categorized into two distinct groups:

1. **With Helmet**: This category contains 23,000 images in JPEG format, showcasing riders wearing helmets.
  
2. **No Helmet**: This category comprises 18,000 images in JPEG format, depicting riders without helmets.

The dataset is ideal for developing and training machine learning models aimed at enhancing rider safety by accurately detecting the presence of a helmet. The large number of images ensures that models trained on this dataset can generalize well to real-world scenarios.
